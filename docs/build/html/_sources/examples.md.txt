# Examples

```{note}
Please note that this website is currently under development. In the meantime, we have provided a collection of examples already included in the Combustion Toolbox repository for your convenience.
``````

Combustion Toolbox can be used through:

* the user-friendly Graphic User Interface (GUI),
* the desktop environment (plain code mode).

Here we have a collection of examples included in the Combustion Toolbox using the desktop environment.
