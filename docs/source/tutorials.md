Combustion Toolbox can be used in two different ways: as a GUI-based application or as plain code. The GUI-based application is the easiest way to use the code, but it is limited to the capabilities of the GUI. The plain code mode is more flexible and allows the user to access all the capabilities of the code. In this section, we will cover a collection of tutorials that will help you to get started with the Combustion Toolbox.
